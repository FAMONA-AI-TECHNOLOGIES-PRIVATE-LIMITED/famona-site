# FamonaAI Project Guidelines

## Strategic Philosophy: UPOD (Under-Promise, Over-Deliver)
All technical and strategic outputs must adhere to the **UPOD Directive**. 
- Frame findings as **preliminary** or **exploratory**.
- Focus on **baseline technical mapping** rather than superlative claims.
- Prioritize **accuracy and precision** over marketing narrative.

## Operating Protocol: IP-Silence (Zero-Disclosure)
- **Zero-Reveal**: The internal logic of the NASH23 GOS (e.g., 8-layer gate logic) must never be disclosed in public-facing or collaborative artifacts.
- **Outcome Verification**: Interaction with stakeholders focuses exclusively on **Verification Outputs**.
- **Surface Minimization**: Use "Regulatory Invariants" rather than "Technical Specifications."

## Technical Commands
- **Run dev server**: `npm run dev` (in `famona-premium-vision`)
- **Build app**: `npm run build`
- **Lint code**: `npm run lint`

## Code Style
- **Stack**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons.
- **Styling**: High-fidelity CSS-based Glassmorphism. Avoid over-engineering.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript is mandatory for all core logic.
- **Documentation**: All new features must be documented in the "Ghost Library" (brain directory) using sophisticated, formal terminology.

## Workflow
1. **Plan before execution**: Use the `task_boundary` tool and `implementation_plan.md`.
2. **Iterative Development**: Make small, verifiable changes.
3. **Verify Assumptions**: Always check statutory requirements (DPDP Act) before implementing governance logic.
